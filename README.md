# ATM-Machine
This program creates an ATM simulator with basic functionality.

The user first enters their id number and pin number. The list of customer id's and corresponding pin numbers are provided in a CSV file. The CSV file is then scanned and a dictionary is created, in which the key corresponds to the customer id and value corresponds to the pin number. 

If successful, the user will be presented with the option to view their checkings or savings.
Both the checking and savings account allow you to view balance, withdraw, and deposit. 
When the user exits, a list of their transaction history is displayed.
