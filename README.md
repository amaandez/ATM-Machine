# ATM-Machine
This program mimics an ATM Machine. 
The user has to first enter their id number and pin number. If successful, the user will be presented with the option to view their checkings or savings.
Both the checking and savings account allow you to view balance, withdraw, and deposit. 
When the user exits, a list of their transaction history is displayed. 

The list of customer id's and corresponding pin numbers are provided in a CSV file. The CSV file is then scanned and a dictionary is created, with the key corresponding to the customer id and value corresponding to the pin number.
